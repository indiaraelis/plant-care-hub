## üìù About the Project

The **Plant-Care Hub** is a full-stack web application designed to help users efficiently manage and track the care routines for their plants. Built with **React** for a dynamic frontend and **Node.js with Express.js** for a robust backend, it allows users to securely register, log in, and maintain a personalized dashboard of their plants.

The application enables comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for plant records, including details like watering and fertilizing frequencies. It also integrates with the **Trefle.io API** to provide detailed information about plant species, making it easier for users to identify and care for their greenery.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Plant-Care Hub on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js** (includes npm): [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* **MongoDB**: [Install MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or set up a free cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/indiaraelis/plant-care-hub.git](https://github.com/indiaraelis/plant-care-hub.git)
    cd plant-care-hub
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    Navigate to the `backend` directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:

    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=a_very_secret_key_for_jwt
    TREFLE_API_KEY=your_trefle_api_key
    ```
    *Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your MongoDB URI (e.g., from MongoDB Atlas).*
    *Replace `a_very_secret_key_for_jwt` with a strong, random string.*
    *Replace `your_trefle_api_key` with your API key obtained from [Trefle.io](https://trefle.io/).*

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

    The frontend is configured to communicate with `http://localhost:5000` by default.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    From the `backend` directory:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The backend server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    From the `frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The React development server will start (typically on `http://localhost:3000`) and open the application in your default web browser.

You can now register a new account, log in, and begin managing your plants!

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following RESTful API endpoints:

**Authentication:**

* `POST /api/auth/register` - Registers a new user.
* `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.

**Plants (requires JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header):**

* `GET /api/plants` - Retrieves all plants belonging to the authenticated user.
* `POST /api/plants` - Creates a new plant for the authenticated user.
* `GET /api/plants/:id` - Retrieves a specific plant by its ID.
* `PUT /api/plants/:id` - Updates an existing plant by its ID.
* `DELETE /api/plants/:id` - Deletes a plant by its ID.

**Trefle.io Integration (requires JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header):**

* `GET /api/trefle/search?query=plantName` - Searches for plant information using the Trefle.io API and returns results.
